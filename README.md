❤️Looking forward to tackling challenges and utilizing data analysis and modeling techniques to enhance business decision-making efforts. During my academic experience, I managed to be recognized for excellent results and strong analytical skills. My doctoral thesis using data from WhatsApp groups was used as a technical foundation for the Parliamentary Inquiry Commission on the use of FAKENEWS to disseminate disinformation about public health (COVID-19) and democracy in Brazil. I developed several projects, working with teams in a collaborative way, highly capable of analyzing large volumes of data with precision and guaranteeing high excellence reports that bring unique insights. I'm always interested in exchanging ideas about data analytics 🎲🎲🎲 and information security 🔐 , so feel free to chat with me. :) 🤝
